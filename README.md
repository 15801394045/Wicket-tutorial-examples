Wicket-tutorial-examples
========================

This repository contains the example projects used in my [Wicket free user guide](http://code.google.com/p/wicket-guide/).

## Building the project

The project is a multi-module Maven project. To compile it run 'mvn compile' from the root directory. 
To run a single example enter in the related directory, run 'mvn jetty:run' or 'mvn tomcat:run' and then point your browser to http://localhost:8080

## The book

[Wicket user guide](http://code.google.com/p/wicket-guide/) is a free manual for Apache Wicket aimed at both beginners and more advanced users of this framework. The version of Wicket covered in the manual is the 6. 

## The author
